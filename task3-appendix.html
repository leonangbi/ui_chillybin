            <p>1. Match between system and the real world (language/ icon used in the system is readable for user)
</p> 
            <p>2. Consistency and standard:
Keep using one word/object/operation to represent the same thing.
</p>
            <p>3. Visibility of system status:
User could see what is going on when they make every operation. User should be provided with appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.
</p>
            <p>4. Does the onboarding process make sense to user.
Tutorial introduces all the main functions and user could have a basic understanding on system.
No confusing or misleading language used.

</p>
            <p>5. User would always know where they are located within the overall system
Does the app allow users to redo & undo (back button).(e.g. go back to the home page whenever they are)

</p>
            <p>6. Error prevention & recovery from error:
Good error message
buttons & layout not causing confusion for users
If an error occurs, either the app auto-fix it or it instruct users to counter it
</p> 
            <p>7. Aesthetic and intuitive design
No irrelevant or rarely needed content for the task being performed.
</p>
            <p>8. Recognition rather than recall (minimise demands on human memory)
Visibility of what each button/page stand for in the system.
Information and function should be available at the point where users are likely to need them.
</p>
            <p>9. Flexibility and efficiency of use
All users include people who is not a professional trainer would comprehend. 
Does it support people who are using it the first time.
Accelerator keys available for experienced user
</p>
             
            <p>10. Help and documentation
design the need for separate help systems

            <p>"It hard to navigate through the app because walkthrough doesn’t explain everything"</p>
             
            <p>"What if you want to be friends with someone who isn’t in the same community as you, how do you become friends with someone (this isn’t explained)" 
</p>
            <p>"Need an overall approach or summary for the entire up at the start of the app because you have actually explained the whole point of the app"</p> 
             
            <p>"I don’t like the idea that you can only be friends with people in the community that you join."</p>
             
            <p>"What if I am in a different community but also want to be friends with one of my friends in a different community."</p>
             
            <p>"Privacy options need to be better- For example if I don’t want people to know how much I weigh I would like to retract out from people’s views."</p>

            <p><strong>Oscar</strong></p>
            <p>"Thought it was more about social media platform then it was about dieting on Health"</p>
            
            <p>"Looks good, Nice and simple"</p>
             
            <p>"I like the idea of the community but I’m unsure of how it works and what’s the point of it. Is there like a discussion page? Or is it just the feed like Instagram for example. "</p>
            
            <p>"They need to be more enticement for joining a community otherwise I don’t see the point. Maybe you could incorporate the gains system with it."</p>
             
            <p><strong>Benji</strong></p>
             
            <p>"Would be good to incorporate a better colour scheme"</p>
             
            <p>"Although I like the simplicity of the layout and I could tell that it was a real app it would have a nice flow and would be easy to use."</p>
             
            <p>"I think this app is a great idea although I think you need to explain how it works more because I was a bit confused and had to ask you"</p>
             
            <p><strong>Flynn</strong></p>
             
            <p>"Really like the idea of having your food delivered as part of the one of the apps featuresm, it seems like it would be seamless but would need to see it in real life to be fully convinced."</p>
             
             <p>"Pop was difficult to navigate through and hard to distinguish from if it was a real app."</p>
             <p>"Is there a way to cross of items on the shopping list if I already have them at home."</p>
             
             <p><strong>Tess</strong></p>
             
             <p>"I like the layout of the diet plan page it flows nicely and i understand it straight away."</p>

             <p>"I love the idea about having a community but maybe you need more things that actually make people want to join one. Like i get it if it's for motivational purposes but i'm not sure if that'll be enough."</p>
             
             <p>"Really like the idea of this app though it seems like something id definitely use."</p>
             
             <p>"It seems like it'd be seamless and it takes out so much of the admin when doing a manual diet and shopping yourself. It's all automates which is fantastic ad super easy."</p>
