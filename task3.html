            <h1 id="part1">Introduction</h1>
            <p>Our awesome diet planning app -- Blitz, offers a new lifestyle for athletes.
</p>
            <p>Our group has proposed a solution to the problem of the lack of nutrition in athletes. We have created prototypes that we believe will change the game of how people eat food day to day and therefore push themselves on the field due to their new and improved diet.  


            <P>This screen-based user interface we have created is an application which will produce a personalised diet plan according to your goals and deliver the food straight to your front door either as pre-cooked/packed meals, raw ingredients or as a shopping list so you can go into the store and buy the items yourself.</P> 
            <P>Our service will provide you with week to week delivery depending on when you would like to change it up if you get bored, or you can stay on your customised diet plan for as long as you wish. You can modify the time of your plan and delivery service at any time and swap out or change certain items you dislike. There is no more forgetting items as you aimlessly go to the local grocery store and pick the items you think you need. </P>
            <P>No more temptations as you stroll down the aisles and gaze at that chocolate bar that's staring back at you, there is no confusion on what to cook, and there is no more empty pantries! To make all this possible all you have to do is fill out our in-depth body status questionnaire upon the initial download and you will be on your way to achieving your goals.</p>
                
            <h1 id="part2">Reaseach insights from task 1</h1>
            <p>In task 1, our group studied the problem scenario that Athletes are not performing to their full potential due to their lack of nutrition.</p>
             
            <p>From our conducted research methods such as interviews, questionnaires, and day to day observations, we found that most nutritional deficiencies occur due to laziness and miss-organised or misinformed nutritional knowledge. This then leads to a decline in the athlete’s ability to perform at their maximum level.</p>
            
            <p>Countless articles are telling us how to have a balanced diet and how to be able to perform better. So why are people lacking in nutrition and still eating unhealthy? Task one research has enlightened us that many people are not able to cook for themselves, they struggle with diet planning, they just simply can't be bothered.</p>
             
            <h1 id="part2-1">Problem overview</h1>
            
            <p>Throughout our design process, we realised that our service is best suited to help athletes, and if you have a body, you are an athlete. We are all athletes, and we all need help with our diets, we are here to help anyone who desires it. </p>
            
            <p>Understadably, athletes indeed need to maintain a well balanced nutritious diet to maintain their best performance in their chosen field.</p>
            
            <p>However, Most athletes are often required to visit a dietitian, nutritionist or read through numerous contradicting articles about the best way to eat day to day and so on. A typical person won't fulfill a simple task like this as it is too much effort for them. We found out that the majority of the problem was due to the amount of effort required to perform a simple task. The lack of effort will then affect the athlete's performance.</p>
             
            <p>The objective of this design project is to improve the nutritional status of athletes to maximize their performances by providing them with a convenient, seamless and autonomous way of tackling their problems related to nutrition and therefore become better athletes and improve their health. </p>
            
            <h1 id="part3">Design concepts</h1>
             
            <h3 id="part3-1-1-1">1. An automatic cooking pot</h3>
             
            <img src="Web_img_folder/Automactic%20cooking%20pot.jpg"/>
             
            <p>An automatic cooking pot that have a remote app and a food market which sells the best ingredients. It could recommend food and recipes for users. The system collects user information and suggests a diet based on the nutrient needs of individuals.The user will not need to search for recipes.</p>
             
            <P>The cooking pot prepares nutritious meals as long as the raw ingredients are put in. It would maintain the nutrition and therefore produce healthy and safe food with the best quality.</P>

            <p>The user’s health condition would be improved gradually if they keep eating what the machine has recommended and cooked. Eventually, their athletic performance would be maximised.</p>
             
          
            
            <h3 id="part3-1-1-2">2. An automovtive wristband</h3>
             
            <img src="Web_img_folder/Automatic%20wrist%20band.jpg" />
            <p>It has a built-in blood analysis device, which extracts a small amount of blood and then sends to the device for analysis. After the blood analysis is done, It will send the analysis to the connected application for a more comprehensive and accurate depiction to their health statuses, then to make appropriate modifications accordingly. </p>
            
           
             
            <h3 id="part3-1-1-3">3. An athlete based diet application</h3>
             
            <img src="Web_img_folder/Diet%20plan.jpg" />
             
            <p>Starts with an application that allows you to follow your progress with your diet and desired goals.
            You will be asked to go through steps that will aid the application to formulate a personalised diet plan for you, your body, and your goals. 
            For example - how old you are, how tall, weight, metabolism rate, body fat, etc.. 
</p>
            <p>The app will give you the option to be put in certain pools tailored to relative goals from people all around the country so you can race people and compete against each other to win prizes, and also have a sense of community. You will be able to see other peoples' progress so you can compare them with your own. This way you have an idea of where you could or should be, and could use it as motivation.
</p>
            <p>Then the app will generate a personalised diet for users to follow but will also allow them to swap out or choose different preferences depending on allergies if they are vegan or vegetarian and have certain likes and dislikes.</p>
             
            <p>After your diet has been generated, you can then easily order pre-prepared meals, raw ingredients, or go into the store and buy the ingredients yourself with a chronologically organised shopping list for the athlete supermarkets or you can browse through your new group and get to know the others by messaging them.</p>
             
            <p>Each day you are able to gain points (gains) that will allow you to easily follow your progress and give you some incentive to win prizes each month or few months depending on how many ‘gains’ you’ve made. For example, by the end of a hypothetical day, you could have obtained 150 gains that count towards your total by the end of the time period.</p>
             
            
            <h1 id="part4">Rationale for the Chosen Solution</h1>
             
            <p> As the rationale, the user would use the app as a guide to their daily diets and be able to easily order food from the app to your front door. 
</p>
            <p>As a group we decided to take on our concept number 3, which was our idea to have an athlete based supermarket with app included. We thought about all the diet apps out there and came to the conclusion that they're all require far to much inputting of calorific data throughout the day to the point where you get nothing else done. For example, ‘My Fitness Pal’ application (logo showing below) is  very popular and well use app in the fitness community which helps track and regulate your calorie intake. But to do this you have to input and enter every gram, and every food group that you consume every day.</p>
            <img src="Web_img_folder/Sample%20logo.jpg" />
             
            <p>Through our research conducted in task one, we found that people are often too lazy to follow a diet and stick to it, so we knew that this technique would be far to annoying and people would use it for a day and forget about it.
</p>
            <p>After much brainstorming we figured that there must be an easier way to track your diet without fail. We looked into nielsen's usability heuristics and used these as a guideline to help us decided on our solution.</p>
             
            <P>Therefore, we thought that this idea was best suitable for us as it was the most feasible and realistic option that we could visualise in the real world today. The user will use the app as a plan to their daily diet, and be able to easily order food from the app to their front door. 
</P>
            <p>This screen based interactive design will be a diet planning application that creates a personalised diet plan according to the users goals after a tailored in depth questionnaire is completed. 
            The app then allows you to order the food straight from your phone and you can choose if you would like your meals to be precooked and packaged, or if you would like the raw ingredients so you can cook yourself.
</p>
            <P>By using this app, you would also know exactly what you're eating. It's designed to aid your goals so that you can feel your performance increasing, energy levels rising and health increasing; because we know based on research from task one that due to diet, people often feel lazy and unproductive which is a hard cycle to break through due to the amount of effort required to start fresh. With Blitz, dieting life becomes effortless. Simplifying eating habits with nutrition on autopilot.</P>

            <h1 id="part9" >Evidence of development of paper prototypes</h1>
            <p>The paper prototypes conveyed the basic ideas of the application. The design solution is set to be helpful users with their healthy diet planning with minimal operation needed. Our design ethics were to give the user enough freedom when they want to make their own choice, to better adapt to their individual needs, while the app providing convenience. The pre-calculated nutritional information and daily energy intake free user from record and planning all their diet. It is in the usability test for the prototypes, we utilised think-aloud protocol. User were given the task of sign up to the app, go through the screens and make a food order with it. 
</p>
            
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The image below shows the progress of user testing the prototypes.</p>
            <img src="Web_img_folder/User%20pics.jpg" />
            
            <p>They were asked to attempt all the operations on themselves with no help or instruction from the design team. During the process of testing, user should speak out the problem with the unclear parts and also the inappropriate design. The users gave some positive feedback on the whole design and also critiques with things that could be improved. It helps us on further development for the app. </p>
             
            <p>According to user feedback in testing, we critically analysed the issues. According to Nielsen’s heuristics, the main points those violate our heuristics is it lacks on visibility of system status and error prevention. As user quoted, 
            <blockquote>“Page needs title so people know this is derived from the choosing of a community.” - Test User</blockquote> 
            
            <p>which indicating some pages are lacking titles and user could not quickly understand what the page is for. </p>
            <p>For it was a paper prototype, it is fine that the interactions and functions were not fully shown but we should let users feel they are in control of the system when they are using it. User would like to know where they are located all the time. All the language should be comprehensible to users instead of letting them to guess. Also, it is important to reduce the memory load when using the app for the best user experience.</p>
             
            <p>After analysis and reflection , we have considered on the way of development. Add a tutorial after the account is set up. We should also edit the language used in the interface, make sure they make sense to all the users and keep the consistency of the interface and language. This would improve the coherence of the app. Then we produced a version of mid-fidelity prototype on Balsamiq for a second round of user testing.</p>


</p>
            <h1 id="part10">Evidence of development of high-fidelity prototypes</h1>
          
            <p>In the development and user testing of our high fidelity Balsamiq prototypes, we tested with many different users and managed to attain very useful feedback which then fed into further developments for our design. We used Nielsen's usability heuristics to help us with this process. 
</p>
            <p>We have catered raw data and included some useful quotes that influenced our design evolution. During this process, we found that a common issue was that we, “need an overall summary for the entire app at the start. People are jumping right into it without having a comprehensive overview of what this service does. This feedback then allowed us to write a small paragraph explaining the features of the application which reads; ‘Blitz created a seamless process which entails a fully automated personalized diet plan that can be delivered right to your doorstep. This app takes all the hassle out of dieting. Choose from a range of options such as ready to go pre-packed meals, raw ingredients, or a shopping list. Blitz Nutrition on autopilot. We also found that there was a correlation between that issue and this issue</p>
          
            <blockquote>“it was It hard to navigate through the app because walkthrough doesn’t explain everything.” -Test users</blockquote>
          
            <p>Therefore by adding a succinct overview of the app is made to do at the start, people were able to navigate through the app without having used it before with much more ease easier.  
</p>
            <p>Deriving from Nielsen's heuristics we discovered a problem with the aesthetic and intuitive design. Initially, we used more of a random colour palette with no real direction that was somewhat confusing for participants who tested the application in phase 2. We had comments such as:</p>
          
            <blockquote>“Would be good to incorporate a better colour scheme” --Test user</blockquote>
          
            <blockquote>“a less confusing colour palette might be a nice addition in the future.” --Test user</blockquote>
          
            <p>In this manner, we discussed this as a group and decided that we shall still keep a minimalistic look to our design but more distinguishable colours might help with the direction and overall feel of the application. So we went with blue white and black colours to keep the same athletic and upbeat aesthetic. After this adjustment users had no complaints and appeared to enjoy the vibrant simple feel that the application portrayed.</p>
          
            <p>Another issue we found from user testing, was that people found the idea of a community interesting but not necessary, as there was no incentive to use the feature. As a group, we thought this feature was necessary, but needed a way to draw in potential motivation, as explained by prototype user</p>
            <blockquote>“There needs to be more enticement for joining a community otherwise I don’t see the point.” - Test user</blockquote>
          
            <p>We proceeded to brainstorm and came up with the idea to include the gains system. For example, within communities, people can create challenges and join them for a chance to win gains that can be used for discounts on future food orders. This allows people to enjoy fitness, and gain incentive into staying on track, keeping fit, and remain healthy. We thought this was a good way to keep users actively participating, which not only benefits us, but also the entire client base with their health. 
</p>
            <h1 id="part11">Video walk through for clickable prototype</h1>

            <p>For the final high-fidelity prototype, the feedback we gathered from tutor and users in the early design have been critically incorporated. An overall summary of the app has been added as Guide Pages, presents the brand ethics. Introduce to user that we are going to generate personalised diets for them. By following our diet plan, eating healthily would be easy and they do not have to worry about diet planning anymore. The app recommends diets based on individual’s body status and healthy goals. These diets helps fulfil the users daily energy and nutrient needs. As a result, promote the occurrence of sign up behavior.
</p>
            <p>User could glance over them to have a quick overview of the highlights of the App. It only appears once the app is first opened after installation. It gives first-time experiencer a clear overview of what does the app do and how would they benefit from the app. </p>
          
            <p>As the result, we have replaced the whole tutorial walk-through process with brief instructions because the proposed ones takes a long time to read through.

            <h1 id="part13"> Proposal for next steps</h1>
            <p>To further develop, and enhance the overall user experience that could be provided by the app, there are a few potential steps that could be actively engaged, to improve the existing app.
</p>
            <p>Firstly, the app is a carefully picked choice out of three team based paths that has been stated previously, and has been refined based on the initial problem area that the team identified at the beginning : Reduced performance level among athletes, due to nutritional deficiencies.  With the problem in mind, the app has been granted a very specific and dedicated target group as athletes, and serves one majorly purpose, that is, to integrate the authentic food resources only for athletes, to maximise their performances by giving them the balanced meals consistently, each and every day. 
</p>
            <p>The similar applications indeed existing on the market, and most of them are either owned or partnered with huge company as Woolworths and Coles. However, as these companies do have mass user base and built-up reputation, the delicacy and focusing group are not yet being set as athletes. Considering athletes are a field that has increasingly amount of attention in the current era, with more and more sports being opened and set available for more globally competitive matches, not only the personal skill sets from individual athletes are important, but also the energy intake is equally crucial.</p>
           
            <p>With this in mind, the team has filtered many possible outcomes, and carefully balanced in all available paths, decided to utilise the underestimated field well enough, to better serve the possibly underestimated  but increasing demands from athletes: energy consumption, to help, and ensure them to have a better and stable performance. </p>
          
            <p>The app being built mainly with 4 different parts, each being unique, engaging, also interconnected with each other, to emphasis with the athletes centred design approach when possible.</p>
            
            <h4 id="part13-1">Food market</h4>
            <p>First part, being the most important ones, is the food market. As the core of the application, ideally, it will be partnered with the most suitable food providers, to offer a convenient and easy online shopping experiences for both all the athletes who are busying at training most of the time and their nutrition team</p>
          
            <p>Moreover, if the athlete and the nutrition team ever feel up to it, they could always go to the retailers which will located near major training centres and locations where can be easily accessed by the sports team, for a clearer and faster shopping experience, which will greatly reduce the delivery time, if the food source is running low. In addition, alternatively, the food market also have prepared boxed meal that are being stocked with the same food providers, to ensure the quality, also to save precious time for athletes by just purchase them in store, or ordering online. 
</p>
            <h4 id="part13-2">Community feature</h4>
            <p>Secondly, the application does have built-in community features, which allows both athletes and nutrition team to share daily life moments, and more importantly, to actively engage with different athletes around the world, connect them together, to provide a sense of community and connections in between. With the community as second core functionality of the application, it brings the application to life, instead of just being a usable application with disconnected users in between, which would be rather blend and less engaging to use.    
</p>
            <h4 id="part13-3">Points(gains) centre</h4>
            <p>Thirdly, to better accommodate and enhance the community feature stated before, there is also a points centre being the third core feature of the app.</p>
            
            <p>The point centre will allow the user to earn points, based on their progress with the recommended meals. Users will be given points with just logging in everyday and check the daily recommended meal plans once they have done so; the user could also redeem points once they have enough, for discount vouchers that can be used when purchasing in store or online, and by doing so, there will also have achievements being granted to user accordingly, to give them the sense of satisfaction and encourage them to further improve themselves.</p>
          
            <p>All being said, at the end, with incorporating the point system, it enhanced the experiences of community feature, allows the application to be more engaging and exciting to use without have lack of consistency, which will ultimately cause the loss of user base.</p>
            
            <h4 id="part13-4">Personalised meal plan </h4>
            <p>Finally, each user will be asked to provide personal body status after the account registration and goals setting, then there will be daily recommended meal plan according to different body status and goals.</p>

            <p>By having personalised body data of each registered user, the daily recommended meal plan are being created based on different body conditions that each different users provided, so to offer a guideline for users to reference on. This potentially solves the problem that new athletes that newly entered the sports field without any nutrition team to provide help or guides on, they could still choose to trust the application provided meal plan, for an easier meal tracking to stay align with the goals that have been set earlier.</p>
          
            <p>In conclusion, the personalised meal plan offers flexibilities for all the user to follow without spending too much time on finding just which type of meal is suitable, or to worry about whether the food are being responsibly resourced, allowing them to focus on what matters the most to them without being distracted.</p>
          
            <h4 id="part13-5">Future plan</h4>
            <p>From the core functions being stated, the foundation of the application has been laid solidly, and ready to be taken to the next step.</p>
            
            <p>To prepare the application for real life challenges, as a first step, the application needs to find appropriate and suitable food providers around the world, considering the food is the most critical part of the application.</p>
            
            <p>To ensure the quality of the food that will be provided to the athletes as mass user base of the application, all the food, including raw ingredients and boxed meal will be checked and proved to meet the local food safety protocol before distributing them in store and made available to the athletes. Also, the food will be downgrade for live stock food once they are expired, for a more economic and environment friendly approach. 
</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the partnership will also be helpful to gain reputation and credibility of the app. When having partnership with suitable personnel, the application can be represented by the chosen one, and to have possibly limited edition product being made available to the public, to attract more users, to expand the current user base.</p>
          
            <p>Moreover, the points system could be partnered with famous athletes or fitness personnels, once the user has enough points. The user will be given an opportunity to meet with them, to be trained on for a short time period, or to have limited time access to exclusive gym and many other awards that could be chosen from. </p>
          
            <p>To bring the application even closer to reality, the food market could host meetings and sports game periodically, to gather users who are interested, for a more engaging and connected experiences for the user base. The meetings could have famous in field athletes talking about personal experience, their ways of training and eating, to tide the each and every member who joined the community together, for a better and stronger engagement.</p>
          
            <p>The retailer could also have help desks both available online and in-store, to solve any possible issues that users might have along the way. In addition, there can have pop-up store available for everyone that are not only offering merchandise, but also inform the public about the importance of keeping a healthy status and doing regular exercises when they have spare time to do so. In this way, the application is not just simply a functional digital interface, but also a tightly emotional connected community that brings everyone together, and promote a better living style and spread positive energy across the place.
